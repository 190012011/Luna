# SN-MLTB # Fully Based On WZML . 

Base Repo : https://github.com/weebzone/WZML

# Fork or import heroku branch only . If you already fork both branch then delete master branch . I wish it will help to protect ban from server .

# Instruction #

Edit Config From Here .
Upload token.pickle and service accounts json here.

This docker is unable to extract accounts.zip . So create a folder name accounts and upload all service accounts json in accounts folder.
If you add anything in heroku branch you need to run workflow to load changes .
